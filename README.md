# react-button-mutation-with-inbrowser-babel
my quotes from .js file to show how I understand React approach:
"// object destructurisation by useState, or we can say that here we create states for App functional component; 
method of React object for creation new vars: buttonText and setButtonText,
to use them later in arrow functions for second "App" function calling and since that changing real-DOM by "App" function JSX return

// here we return all that App functional component of virtual-Dom change in
React and then that JSX compiling by Babel and in result we see new elements in real-DOM
